PRODUCTS
Medicare Supplement: Point-of-sale underwriting, guided enrollment, real-time decisioning for the most competitive market in insurance. Helps carriers drive sustainable growth, improve underwriting mix by moving decisions upstream, win agent preference through speed and simplicity, and move faster with product changes and market expansion.

Preneed: Modernized for consistency and quality. Transforms paper-driven market into digital. Moved carriers from ~20% to 100% electronic submissions. Straight-through processing from essentially 0% to over 60%. Improves quality through consistency. Supports innovation without disrupting distribution.

Final Expense: Simplified without compromise. Supports tiered underwriting (First Day Coverage, Graded, Guaranteed Issue) in one workflow. Rapidly shifts mix toward more First Day Coverage. True one-stop shop for agents. Growth from $3M to $30M+ annual run rate achieved in production.

Annuity: Reimagined for modern buying experience. Replaces legacy friction with modern point-of-sale workflow. Innovates without disrupting core systems (operates as system of engagement). Improves agent confidence and consistency.

Ancillary Health (HI, CI, STC): Built to handle variation, volume, and speed. Supports Hospital Indemnity, Critical Illness, and Short-Term Care in one configurable platform.

OUR TOOLS
Activity Map: Real-time visual view of business activity across products and geographies.
My Easy Match: Automatically pairs customers with most appropriate product. Removes guesswork for agents.
MyEnroller Messaging: Integrated messaging within the enrollment workflow. Reduces follow-ups and off-platform coordination.
Instant Incentives: Real-time incentive visibility embedded in enrollment. Aligns agent behavior with carrier objectives immediately.
Application Scanning Tool: Converts paper applications into structured digital submissions. Enables digital adoption without disrupting distribution.
Lead Gen Tools: Supports digital lead capture and routing into guided enrollment workflows.

CASE STUDIES
Time to Market: Mid-sized regional carrier. Challenge: slow product change cycles. Solution: MyEnroller as system of engagement. Impact: more frequent enhancements, shorter launch cycles (months to weeks), increased experimentation, year-over-year growth more than doubled.

Business Growth (Wellabe): Mutual insurance organization. Challenge: growing faster without operational strain. Solution: MyEnroller for rapid iteration. Impact: more rapid product iteration, shortened launch timelines, year-over-year sales more than doubled, sustainable execution at scale.

Quality of Business: Multi-product carrier. Challenge: inconsistent application quality in certain channels. Solution: MyEnroller to apply guardrails consistently, guide applicants toward higher-quality submissions. Impact: higher underwriting success rates, improved consistency across channels, access to previously avoided distribution segments.

Agent Satisfaction: Multi-product carrier. Challenge: complex applications, unclear underwriting outcomes creating friction. Agent quotes: "The platform is simple and easy to use. It looks good and is intuitive. It guides the user through the process like Amazon." / "This is the easiest system I use compared to other carriers. Auto-underwriting is amazing." / "If all carriers used a system like this, my life would be much simpler and better." Impact: increased agent preference, greater confidence at point of sale, higher quality submissions, stronger long-term engagement.
